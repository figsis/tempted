<p> This is almost the end of Task 3. You will now have the opportunity to think more about your decision in this task and possibly alter your final payoff.

    In the next screen you will face a red button. If you press it, then you will receive X and the charity will receive Y.
    If you do not press it, the charity will receive X and you will receive Y. </p>

     <p>This decision will override the previous one and thus determine your final payoff for this task. </p>


      <p> Press "Next" to reconsider Task 3. </p>
